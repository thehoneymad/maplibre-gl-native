# Using Conan.io instead of Mason
MapLibre GL Native stil uses [Mason](https://github.com/mapbox/mason), Mapbox's depcreated cross platform C/C++ package manager to resolve precompiled binaries for third party dependencies.

This document speaks towards using [Conan.io](https://conan.io/) instead of Mason to resolve C/C++ precompiled binaries for third-party dependencies.

## Motivation
MapLibre GL Native was forked off Mapbox GL Native. This means for historical reasons MapLibre GL Native has dependencies maintained by Mapbox. Usage of [Mason](https://github.com/mapbox/mason) is one of them. The motivation behind replacing [Mason](https://github.com/mapbox/mason) are the following:

1. Mason is not actively maintained anymore by Mapbox. Since May 19, 2022, Mason is declared `unmaintained`.
2. Mason strongly prefers static libraries over shared libraries and does not understand dependency trees. A developer is responsible to wiring dependency resolution according to the hierarchy.
3. Mapbox has been aggresively removing their open source footprint. For example, Mapbox geocoder Carmen is not available in Github anymore. This leaves a small risk of Mapbox removing Mason from Github completely. This could lead to build breakage for MapLibre and MapLibre customers.
4. Mason also brings in Mapbox maintained dependencies such as [earcut.cpp](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp) and [geojson-vt-cpp](https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt-cpp). MapLibre currently does not have a fork or mirror for any of these repositories and is susceptive to the same risk mentioned above.
